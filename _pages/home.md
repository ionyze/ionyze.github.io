# About Us

*You need experience to get a job; but you need a job to gain experience.* We're
all too familiar with that barrier; and we're here to help.

Our mission is to enable all aspiring software engineers of **Kern County** gain the
experience they need to get a job.

We help aspiring engineers be better prepared. We make it easier for them to gain
real-world expeirence in order to successfully land their first engineering job.
This is how we'll help:

1. We'll connect you with non-profits who need volunteer engineers.
2. We'll help you build your online portfolio so you can show off your work.
3. If you get stuck on a problem, we'll connect you with the right mentors and help you
  find resources to help you get to a solution.
